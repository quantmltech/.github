## Overview

**Redefining Quantitative Trading Through AI-Native Infrastructure**

QuantML is pioneering institutional trading technology with the financial industry's first knowledge-embedded AI platform—combining machine learning with fundamental financial principles to deliver consistent, explainable, regulatory-compliant alpha generation.

## The Challenge

Quantitative trading faces unprecedented pressure. Traditional models show accelerated alpha decay (63% correlation with ETF proliferation post-2015), regime transitions trigger catastrophic failures (2008, COVID, 2022), and regulators demand explainability under FINRA 3110/3120 and MiFID II—rejecting opaque black-box systems.

## Our Solution

**Regime-Aware Intelligence** — Automatically detects Bull, Neutral, Bear, and Crisis states, dynamically selecting strategies validated for each regime to maintain performance during critical transitions.

**Constraint-Satisfying Architecture** — Embeds financial first principles—no-arbitrage conditions, liquidity bounds, volatility clustering—into neural networks, ensuring predictions remain valid under unprecedented conditions.

**Multi-AI Consensus Engine** — Ten specialized models debate adversarially, requiring 99% confidence thresholds before execution while generating regulatory-compliant audit trails.

**Unified Platform** — Collapses fragmented workflows (research → backtesting → risk → execution) into one reasoning engine, accelerating cycles from weeks to hours.

## Market Context

$44B flowed into quant funds H1 2025. AI strategies now drive 40% of hedge fund volume. Institutions committed $400B toward AI infrastructure through 2027.

## Our Vision

Building the AI-native infrastructure layer powering next-generation quantitative finance—replacing legacy terminals with a unified reasoning platform that operates like an entire research department, 100x faster and fully explainable.
